# Naviya Core Functionality Testing Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide covers testing the core functionality of the Naviya elderly launcher after successfully resolving compilation issues and creating a stable baseline.

## ‚úÖ Build Status: SUCCESSFUL

- **Gradle 8.4 + Java 21**: Clean compilation
- **Kotlin**: All syntax errors resolved
- **Dependencies**: Core dependencies working
- **Test Launcher**: Ready for emulator testing

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### 1. Launch Test Environment

```bash
# From the android directory
./launch_test.sh
```

This script will:
- Build the project
- Install on connected emulator
- Launch the TestLauncherActivity
- Display available test features

### 2. Manual Testing Steps

If you prefer manual testing:

```bash
# Build
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install (with emulator running)
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Launch
adb shell am start -n com.naviya.launcher/.TestLauncherActivity
```

## üß™ Core Features to Test

### 1. 3-Mode System Testing

**Test the mode switching functionality:**

- **ESSENTIAL Mode (1√ó3)**:
  - Should show: Phone, Messages, Contacts
  - Large tiles, minimal interface
  - Ideal for severe cognitive impairment

- **COMFORT Mode (2√ó2)**:
  - Should show: Phone, Messages, Camera, Gallery
  - Balanced layout with creative engagement
  - Standard elderly user interface

- **CONNECTED Mode (2√ó3)**:
  - Should show: All COMFORT apps + Weather, Family Communication
  - Full feature set for tech-comfortable users

**Expected Behavior:**
- Mode switching should be smooth
- Tile layouts should adapt correctly
- Icons should display properly
- Touch targets should be 48dp+ (elderly-friendly)

### 2. Emergency SOS System Testing

**Test emergency activation:**

- Large red "Emergency SOS" button should be visible
- Button should be easily accessible (64dp+ touch target)
- Activation should show confirmation dialog
- Cancellation should work properly

**Expected Behavior:**
- Button always visible regardless of mode
- High contrast colors for visibility
- Clear confirmation flow
- No accidental activation

### 3. Unread Communications Testing

**Test unread tile functionality:**

- Unread tile should display current count
- Refresh functionality should work
- Error states should be handled gracefully
- Accessibility descriptions should be present

**Expected Behavior:**
- Real-time count updates
- Proper error handling
- Elderly-friendly visual design
- Clear status indicators

### 4. UI/UX Accessibility Testing

**Test elderly-friendly design:**

- **Font Scaling**: Text should be 18sp+ minimum
- **Touch Targets**: All buttons 48dp+ minimum
- **Contrast**: High contrast colors throughout
- **Navigation**: Simple, clear navigation flow

**Expected Behavior:**
- Easy to read text at all sizes
- Large, easy-to-tap buttons
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Minimal cognitive load

## üîç Debugging and Monitoring

### View Application Logs

```bash
# Filter for Naviya-specific logs
adb logcat | grep Naviya

# View all logs with timestamps
adb logcat -v time

# Clear logs and start fresh
adb logcat -c && adb logcat | grep Naviya
```

### Performance Monitoring

Monitor for:
- App launch time (should be < 3 seconds)
- Mode switching response (should be < 500ms)
- Emergency button response (should be immediate)
- Memory usage (should be reasonable for elderly devices)

## üéØ Validation Checklist

### Core Functionality ‚úÖ
- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] 3-mode system works correctly
- [ ] Emergency SOS button functional
- [ ] Unread tile displays and updates
- [ ] Mode switching is smooth
- [ ] No crashes or ANRs

### Accessibility ‚úÖ
- [ ] Large touch targets (48dp+)
- [ ] High contrast colors
- [ ] Large fonts (18sp+)
- [ ] Clear visual hierarchy
- [ ] Simple navigation flow
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully

### Performance ‚úÖ
