 * This activity demonstrates the complete healthcare professional integration system:
 * - Professional Registration with credentials and validation
 * - Professional Installation with consent management and clinical context
 * - Clinical Assessment with comprehensive risk evaluation
 * 
 * Features demonstrated:
 * ‚úÖ Elderly-first accessibility (1.6x font scaling, 48dp touch targets)
 * ‚úÖ Offline-first architecture with local data persistence
 * ‚úÖ Real-time form validation with helpful error messages
 * ‚úÖ Multi-step guided workflows with progress tracking
 * ‚úÖ Risk assessment with automatic elder rights advocate notifications
 * ‚úÖ Integration with abuse detection and emergency alert systems
 * ‚úÖ GDPR-compliant consent management
 * ‚úÖ Professional credential verification and authorization
 * 
 * To run this demo:
 * 1. Launch the app and you'll see the Healthcare Demo Home screen
 * 2. Try each workflow:
 *    - Professional Registration: Complete form with validation
 *    - Professional Installation: 6-step guided installation process
 *    - Clinical Assessment: Comprehensive patient evaluation
 * 3. Watch the console output for integration system notifications
 * 
 * Note: This is a demo version with mock services for testing purposes.
 * In production, this would connect to real healthcare systems and databases.
