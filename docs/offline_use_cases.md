# Offline Use Cases for Naviya Elderly Launcher

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive offline use cases for the Naviya elderly launcher, ensuring critical functionality remains available even without internet connectivity. The system follows an offline-first architecture prioritizing local functionality with opportunistic online synchronization.

## Core Offline Principles
- **Local-First**: All essential features work without network connectivity
- **Graceful Degradation**: Online features degrade gracefully when offline
- **Emergency Priority**: Emergency features always work, even in airplane mode
- **Caregiver Queuing**: Caregiver communications queue for later transmission
- **Data Persistence**: All user data stored locally with Room database

---

## Use Case 1: Emergency SOS in Airplane Mode

### Scenario
Elderly user (Maria, 78) is on a flight and experiences a medical emergency. The device is in airplane mode with no cellular or WiFi connectivity.

### User Flow
1. **Emergency Activation**: Maria presses the large red SOS button
2. **Offline Detection**: System detects no connectivity but continues
3. **Local Emergency Protocol**: 
   - Emergency event logged locally with timestamp
   - Local emergency contacts retrieved from Room database
   - Emergency protocol determined based on cached medical profile
   - Visual/haptic feedback confirms SOS activation
4. **Queued Actions**:
   - Emergency alert queued for transmission when connectivity returns
   - Local emergency information displayed (medical conditions, medications)
   - Caregiver notifications queued with high priority
5. **Manual Fallback**: System displays emergency contact phone numbers for manual dialing

### Technical Implementation
```kotlin
// Emergency activation works offline
suspend fun activateMedicalEmergency(
    userId: String,
    emergencyType: MedicalEmergencyType
): SimpleMedicalEmergencyResult {
    // Log emergency event locally
    val emergencyEvent = EmergencyEvent(
        eventType = EmergencyEventType.SOS_ACTIVATED,
        userId = userId,
        wasOffline = !isNetworkAvailable(),
        notes = "Medical Emergency: $emergencyType"
    )
    emergencyDao.insertEmergencyEvent(emergencyEvent)
    
    // Queue for later transmission
    queueEmergencyAlert(emergencyEvent)
    
    return SimpleMedicalEmergencyResult.Success(
        emergencyResult = localEmergencyProtocol,
        responseTimeMs = responseTime
    )
}
```

### Expected Outcome
- Emergency logged locally ✓
- User receives immediate feedback ✓
- Emergency contacts displayed for manual use ✓
- Alert queued for transmission when online ✓

## Use Case 2: Caregiver Dashboard Monitoring During Internet Outage

### Scenario
Caregiver (John) is monitoring his elderly father (Robert, 82) when the home WiFi goes down. Robert's device loses internet connectivity for 4 hours.

### User Flow - Elderly User Side (Robert)
1. **Offline Transition**: Device detects network loss
2. **Offline Indicator**: Clear "Offline" status shown in UI
3. **Core Functions Continue**:
   - App launching works normally
   - Phone dialer accessible
   - Emergency SOS fully functional
   - Local contacts available
   - Settings accessible
4. **Limited Functions**:
   - No new app downloads
   - No caregiver real-time chat
   - No remote assistance
5. **Data Queuing**: All usage data, health metrics, and activities logged locally

### User Flow - Caregiver Side (John)
1. **Connectivity Loss Notification**: Dashboard shows "Robert - Last seen 4 hours ago"
2. **Offline Status Indicator**: Clear visual indication of offline status
3. **Cached Data Display**: Last known status and metrics displayed
4. **Queued Alerts**: Any emergency alerts queued for immediate delivery when online
5. **Alternative Contact**: SMS/phone options available for direct contact

### Technical Implementation
```kotlin
// Offline caregiver connectivity service
class OfflineCaregiverConnectivityService {
    suspend fun handleOfflineMode() {
        // Enable offline mode
        caregiverDao.updateSystemMode(SystemMode.OFFLINE)
        
        // Queue pending data
        queuePendingData()
        
        // Continue local monitoring
        startLocalMonitoring()
    }
    
    private suspend fun queuePendingData() {
        // Queue usage data, health metrics, activity logs
        val pendingData = collectLocalData()
        caregiverDao.insertPendingSync(pendingData)
    }
}
```

### Expected Outcome
- Robert's device continues normal operation ✓
- John receives offline notification ✓
- All data queued for sync when online ✓

    ): OnboardingResult {
        return try {
            // Store all data locally
            onboardingDao.insertBasicPreferences(preferences)
            onboardingDao.insertEmergencyContacts(emergencyContacts)
            
            // Queue caregiver pairing for later
            queueCaregiverPairing()
            
            OnboardingResult.Success(offlineMode = true)
        } catch (e: Exception) {
            OnboardingResult.Error(e.message)
        }
    }
}
```

## Technical Architecture for Offline Support

### Data Storage Strategy
```kotlin
// Room database entities for offline support
@Entity(tableName = "offline_queue")
data class OfflineQueueItem(
    @PrimaryKey val queueId: String,
    val userId: String,
    val dataType: OfflineDataType,
    val payload: String,
    val priority: QueuePriority,
    val queuedAt: Long,
    val retryCount: Int = 0
)

@Entity(tableName = "emergency_events")
data class EmergencyEvent(
    @PrimaryKey val eventId: String,
    val userId: String,
    val eventType: EmergencyEventType,
    val wasOffline: Boolean,
    val timestamp: Long,
    val syncStatus: SyncStatus = SyncStatus.PENDING
)
```

### Sync Strategy
```kotlin
class OfflineSyncManager {
    suspend fun performOpportunisticSync() {
        when (getConnectionQuality()) {
            ConnectionQuality.HIGH -> performFullSync()
            ConnectionQuality.MEDIUM -> performPrioritizedSync()
            ConnectionQuality.LOW -> performCriticalOnlySync()
        }
    }
    
    private suspend fun performCriticalOnlySync() {
        // Sync only emergency events and critical caregiver data
        val criticalItems = offlineDao.getCriticalQueueItems()
        criticalItems.forEach { item ->
            attemptSync(item)
        }
    }
}
```

### Battery Optimization
```kotlin
class OfflineBatteryManager {
    fun enableExtendedOfflineMode() {
        // Reduce background sync attempts
        // Optimize screen brightness
        // Minimize non-essential services
        // Preserve emergency functionality
    }
}
```
