  Performance optimization rules specifically designed for elderly users'
  devices which may be older or have limited resources. Focuses on memory
  efficiency and battery optimization for extended usage.

# Limit memory usage
- name: "elderly_memory_limit"
  pattern: "bitmap|image|cache"
  rule: "Memory usage must be optimized for older devices"
  enforcement: "warning"
  suggestion: "Use image compression and efficient caching"

# Enforce battery optimization
- name: "battery_optimization"
  pattern: "background|service|alarm"
  rule: "Background operations must be battery-efficient"
  enforcement: "warning"
  suggestion: "Use WorkManager for background tasks"

match:
  - event: memory_allocation
  - event: image_loading
  - event: background_task
  - event: battery_usage
  - event: cache_operation

check:
  - memory_usage <= 100MB
  - battery_optimization == true
  - image_compression_enabled == true
  - efficient_caching == true
  - background_tasks_optimized == true

response:
  - monitor_memory_usage()
  - optimize_battery_consumption()
  - enable_image_compression()
  - implement_efficient_caching()
  - optimize_background_tasks()
  - if memory_usage > 100MB:
      show_warning("Memory usage too high - optimize for older devices")
  - if battery_optimization == false:
      show_warning("Battery optimization required for background operations")
  - if image_compression_enabled == false:
      show_warning("Image compression required for memory efficiency")
  - if efficient_caching == false:
      show_warning("Efficient caching required for performance")
  - if background_tasks_optimized == false:
      show_warning("Background tasks must be optimized for battery life")
